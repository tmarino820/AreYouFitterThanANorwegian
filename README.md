## Are You Fitter Than a Norwegian?

Group Members: Jeremy Beckler, Antonio Marino

This is a data-driven website-based project that compares users'
physical fitness to that of Norwegians.

Currently, our homepage -- with route '/' -- allows users to enter
a description of their runs and get their estimated VO2 Max Score
as well as their percentile rank among Norwegians aged 17 to 21.
A VO2 Max Score is a measure of one's cardiovascular endurance
and roughly means the amount of oxygen your body can use (Tanita).
Likewise, one's percentile rank among Norwegians can be thought of
as roughly what percentage of Norwegians is one fitter than.

This site allows students, runners, or research scientists studying
athletic performance might be interested in this data to visualize
how they compare to Norwegians in terms of cardiovascular endurance
and how the fitness levels of Norwegians change across percentiles.
Also, Norwegians might want to compare their fitness against
their peers to see how fit they are. For instance, let us assume
Bjørn is a Norwegian man who is interested in determining his
relative strengths and weaknesses, so he decides to visit
this site and input data from his most recent run. The site
will uses the Jack Daniels equation to output his estimated
VO2 max score along with his percentile rank among his
fellow Norwegians.

We took inspiration for our website from https://strengthlevel.com/.
